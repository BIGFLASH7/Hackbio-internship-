Cheminformatics is a crucial concept in drug discovery, playing a vital role in the development of new treatments for various diseases, including cancer (Leach & Gillet, 2007). It involves the application of computational tools and methods to analyze and interpret large amounts of chemical and biological data, enabling researchers to identify potential drug candidates and optimize their properties (Brown, 2005).

In cancer research, cheminformatics helps to identify novel targets, design lead compounds, and predict drug properties, such as solubility and bioavailability (Walters & Murcko, 2002). It also enables researchers to analyze large datasets, identify patterns, and predict toxicity (Ekins, 2007).

Cheminformatics approaches, such as structure-based drug design, virtual screening, and QSAR modeling, have been successfully applied to various types of cancer, including breast, lung, and leukemia (Cramer et al., 2004).
